## History

I've really wanted a fatbike for years, but I can't really justify the $1k-3k price tag!  I noticed that Kijiji offered a service to automate searches & send you email on matches.  That's cool, but I eventually found myself building
a spreadsheet of ALL the postings, and spending a few minutes each day sorting new posts from old, tracking price changes, noticing trends, and bargain hunting. In the end, I never actually bought one -- the prices really are that high!

But now I'm shopping for cars, and the stakes are a lot higher!

# Goals

Utilities like Kijiji are really useful as a central marketplace where people can find *stuff* for sale, or post their own stuff.
They're really great at their jobs, and there's almost always something for sale.
But if, like me, you're a cheapskate, you want more information to inform your purchasing decisions!
I'm not going to purchase the first durn thing I see -- I want to know:
    * how many similar items were posted, and when?
    * how long do items stay posted, and at what price?
    * when an item is removed, what was the last price?
    * sometimes, an item is posted, taken down, and then re-posted, by the same seller.  
	* Sometimes with the same photos, or not. 
	* Sometimes with an updated price, or not.
	* Sometimes with an updated description, or not.
	* (Sometimes, the seller goes away for the weekend, and doesn't want to take the hit to their reputation, or put up with incessant calls, for a time.)
	* Can you spot these & link them together? 
    * for any individual ad...
	* when was it first posted?
	* how did it change, over its lifetime?  (sometimes people post stuff they didn't want to)
	* was there a price drop?  (motivated seller)
    * I want to track all the postings, and the details about them, for several months
    * I want to be able to add my own metadata to a posting -- like did I test-drive it? What did I find? Was there a McDonald's bag in the back? Were the wheels cheaply painted?
    * About the sellers:
    	* what else have they posted recently?  
	* details about the items?
	* 


## Kijiji.ca

* Hmmm... Reliance on a single URL to drive the search ... is that going to fly?
* Any indication that they have an API that would make this easier?
