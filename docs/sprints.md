# Sprints

* Small steps!

## Completed

* Datestamp the current file...
* Modify server.py to read just the new file
* Build a script to integrate runs, and datestamp individual output files
* My code - deal with multiple input data files

## Next

* Push the data into a sqlite DB?

## Later

* git submodule, to integrate the scraper into my codebase
* Hack the scraper, and make it your own
    * Write data into a better format, probably into a sqlite
    * Capture some of the metadata
