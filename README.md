# kjviewer project

## Immediate Goals 

* automate the querying of data from web-based source
* insert specific data fields into a local database
* make it easy to query data in the format of my choosing

## Longer Term Goals

* Track metadata about the source:
    * when was an entry first posted? 
    * has the source entry been deleted? (note the date!)
    * did the price / description / others field change?
    * Notice which entries have been posted the longest
* Transform the raw data in the database into an API-based service? A
    * sure, you can get all the data
    * but supply some paths that get specific, interesting queries
* ... and build a front-end to display the most important views
